        Penetration Testing Distribution
        Kali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution geared towards various information security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security Research, Computer Forensics and Reverse Engineering.</div>
   <div class="contenido">Kali is a rolling Linux distribution, meaning as soon as we have an update, we ship it. Would-be users have a variety of images to choose from. For more information, please see Which Image Should I Download? and Kali Branches. For most users, we recommend the latest “point release” image below, except in cases when a user requires a specific bug patch, in which case the weekly build may be best.

    We generate fresh Kali Linux image files every quarter. These become the official "point" releases. These images are tested and subsequently announced with a blog post.</div>
